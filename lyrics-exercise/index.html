					Used to fall into my mind<br>
					Visions of you passed the time<br>
					Now I'm growing distant<br>
					My coffee tastes of my indifference
				</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>
					What could it be?<br>
					I don't feel the need<br>
					To wake up thinking of you<br>
					My pillow's dry<br>
					I don't need to fight it over you
				</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>
					Lover I can't see you in my dreams<br>
					Anymore,<br>
					Nobody waiting for me at the door<br>
					Not you no more.<br>
					Lover I can't see you in my mind<br>
					No goodbye,<br>
					Nobody standing there between the lines<br>
					Not you this time.
				</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>
					For the longest time<br>
					Kicking stones by the drive<br>
					Toes touching the pavement<br>
					But the postman never made it
				</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>
					What could it be?<br>
					I don't feel the need<br>
					To wake up thinking of you<br>
					My pillow's dry<br>
					I don't need to fight it over you
				</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>
					Lover I can't see you in my dreams<br>
					Anymore,<br>
					Nobody waiting for me at the door<br>
					Not you no more.<br>
					Lover I can't see you in my mind<br>
					No goodbye,<br>
					Nobody standing there between the lines<br>
					Not you this time.<br>
