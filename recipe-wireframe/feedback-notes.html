		<h1>Feedback Notes for Wireframe</h1>
		<h2>Helen Xiu</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Typeface can be a little overwhelming/hard to read - maybe open it up so its not so small and dense</li>
			<li>other typefaces for consideration - Brandon Grotesque at a lighter weight, neutraface, maybe a serif to class it up </li>
			<li>Color palette not very well thought out - try a more limited approach</li>
			<li>is it possible to do the sideswipe page thing? maybe a bit too ambitious</li>
			<li>design the corners - have a consistent aesthetic that is clean and functional</li>
			<li>smaller head image</li>
			<li>consistent margins</li>
			<li>make each page engaging - don't just have a wall of text - try to have images on every "spread"</li>
			Notes for myself - add a small static down arrow to indicate scroll down if you decide to do a top-down layout
		</ul>
