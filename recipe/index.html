		<h3>In particular...</h3>

		<p>
			This is one of those recipes that always impresses. The flavors are perfect together and I always feel like I have never made enough—especially when my son comes back for thirds! If you have ever eaten Sweet and Spicy Silken fried tofu from a traditional street vendor in Asia you’ll appreciate this recipe, as it utilizes the same cooking techniques to bring you a wonderful rich flavor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quick and super easy, once you gain confidence making the sauce you will become a pro in no time—which is good because if your family is anything like mine, they will be asking for it often.

		<h3>You'll need...</h3>

		<h4>Sauce</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>2 thumb-size pieces of young ginger <br>cut into very thin long strips</li>
				<li>3 large fresh garlic cloves, diced (not minced)</li>
				<li>1 Tbsp sesame oil</li>
				<li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
				<li>2 Tbsp rice vinegar</li>
				<li>4 Tbsp water</li>
				<li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
				<li>2 tsp tomato paste</li>
				<li>1 tsp chili sauce or sweet chili sauce</li>
				<li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
			</ul>

		<h4>Tofu</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>2 x 15 oz blocks of silken tofu</li>
				<li>Flour for dusting</li>
				<li>2 Tbsp sesame oil</li>
			</ul>

		<h4>Sauce Steps</h4>

			<ol>
				<li>In a small pan, gently fry the sliced ginger and diced garlic in the sesame oil until soft and aromatic; <b>do not burn your garlic.</b> Lower the heat before adding the soy sauce, rice vinegar, water, sugar, tomato paste, chili sauce and lime juice. Stir well and let simmer for a few minutes. Taste test. If it’s too intense add a little water, if it lacks flavor, add some more soy sauce, then let simmer for another minute.</li>
			</ol>

		<h4>Tofu Steps</h4>

			<ol>
				<li>I use rice flour or plain flour but I’m sure you can use other flours if you want to experiment. Choose a sensible silken tofu as some are so soft that they are not meant for cooking.</li>
				<li>Slice the tofu into thick slices; I like to cut them about <b>¾-inch thick</b> so they don’t fall apart.</li>
				<li>Place the sliced tofu on a paper towel and pat off excess liquid. Dust the tofu pieces with the flour to form a light coating.</li>
				<li>In a large non-stick pan or iron skillet (my preferred choice), heat 2 Tbsp of sesame oil. Place your tofu in the sesame oil and fry over medium heat for <b>2 minutes on each side</b> or till golden brown and crispy.</li>
				<li>Drizzle the dressing over the tofu while it is still <b>steaming hot.</b> Serve with your favorite steamed Chinese greens or bowl of grains.</li>
				<li>This dish is best eaten right away while it is still hot.</li>
