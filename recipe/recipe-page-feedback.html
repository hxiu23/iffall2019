		<h2>Person 1 Feedback</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				think about other kinds of functionality/context you can provide
			</li>
			<li>
				When scrolling down, one of the images has a blurry top and it might seem like there's something wrong with the image before you get to the whole thing - doesn't look quite intentional - maybe crop the image
			</li>
			<li>
				like the footer with the source link and the final image
			</li>
			<li>
				not super sure of the image of the tofu frying because the lighting is different from the others - find a more well-lit, professional photo
			</li>
			<li>
				spacing is clear - legible line height
			</li>
			<li>
				increase hierarchy of the headers with the underlines - get rid of the dotted underline and maybe switch to sll caps?
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Person 2 Feedback</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				fan of the dotted lines under the titles 
			</li>
			<li>
				Would add a "serve" section at the end that recommends how to plate, or something like "Enjoy" to wrap up the recipe and not end so abruptly
			</li>
			<li>
				Credit on the images
			</li>
			<li>
				increase sense of hierarchy in the instructions - maybe bold or italicize the numbers? increase distinction and contrast
			</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Plans for Adjustment</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				experiment with the underlined titles - will probably keep the Page title with the dotted underline, but change the section headers to be all caps, or distinct in some other way
			</li>
			<li>
				make numbers for the "steps" section larger and off to the side - create a sense of progression and hierarchy
			</li>
			<li>
				add image credits
			</li>
			<li>
				add a "serve" section / sign off
			</li>
			<li>
				find more stylistically consistent image of tofu frying
			</li>
		</ul>

		</ul>
